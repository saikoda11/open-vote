# Blockchain-Based E-Voting Mechanisms: A Survey and a Proposal 

https://doi.org/10.3390/network4040021

Blockchain systems:
Permissionless, Permissioned, Hybrid (open access to authority that gives access), Consortium

Voting Strategies: 
- Borda Count 
    each voter ranks candidates, higher score given for being higher, total count wins, problem - people vote for people just so that disliked majority winner does not win

- Condorcet Method 

    each voter decides which candidate wins in 1v1 setups against each other, 1 point per win in 1v1, highest scorer from all rankings wins, problem - circle

Both strategies are kept in blockchain by smart markers for branching and merging.
The purpose of having both is to aleviate the weaknesses of both.
